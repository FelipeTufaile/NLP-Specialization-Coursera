# NLP with Probabilistic Models - Course 2

## Course Description
  - Create an Auto correct models that calculates probabilities to find the most likely correction of a typo, through considering different possible edits to correct the typo and calculating the minimum edit distance to correct a certain word.
  - **part of speech tagging (POS)** using **hidden Markov model** with the **Viterbi** algorithm. The Viterbi algorithm makes use of dynamic programming, which is an optimization technique that breaks down a big problem into smaller problems and makes use of the optimal solution of those mini problems to solve the whole one. 

## Notebok Description
